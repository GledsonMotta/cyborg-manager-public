# Work in Progress...
## This is my actual project with a set of Applications developed in different Languages/Platforms with purpose of create, manage and track Cyborgs or different types of Robots.
## Soon it will be available in my portal [Haeralis.com](http://haeralis.com).

## The Idea:  

Angular aplication that will act as a UI for creating, instatiating, tracking and managing sets of Machines, Robots, Cyborgs of different types that will fight among themselves virtually.
This UI will communicate with api's of different languages/platforms like Java, NodeJS and PEGA, all disposed in the cloud, except PEGA Platform that will be a personal edition installed in my machine only available for REST consumption.

PEGA Plafrorm will be used for massive processual requests sent by REST from any external source, or manual creation (only by me) directly in the Worker Portal.

## But take it easy!!!

I do this work only in my free time between professional work and social life, and as Mr. Krabs says:
